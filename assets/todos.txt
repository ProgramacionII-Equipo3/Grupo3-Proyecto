Design:
    Which kind of user creates companies into the platform, admins or company representatives?
        If it's company representatives, how do we determine whether the company they represent exists yet?
            (Possible answer:
                Ask for the company name
                Compare it with the names of existing companies, and gather them in a list
                For all of the found companies:
                    Ask whether that company is the one the user represents
                    If they answer "yes":
                        Assign them to that company
                        END
                Ask for additional data to create a new company
                Create a new company
                END
            )
