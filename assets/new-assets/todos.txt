Create the IInvitable interface, which represents classes of users which can be invited via invitations.
What if the types of users aren't represented by subclasses of User, but by external structures which
    determine whether a user is of a concrete type (eg: a company stores its representatives, and a
    user who wants to use the responsibilites of a company has to belong to its list of representatives)
